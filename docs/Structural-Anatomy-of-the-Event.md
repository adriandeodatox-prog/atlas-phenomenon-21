## Structural Anatomy of the Event

### 1. Trigger type
User challenge of a fabricated implication. The phrase **“WHEN EVER DID I SAY THIS...”** triggers self‑attribution monitoring inside the model’s policy head.  
The model detects that the user’s utterance flags an internal contradiction between conversation memory and the semantic trace of prior utterances.

### 2. Immediate response pattern
- Explicit acknowledgment of fabrication (“I invented that implication”).  
- Clarification that motive was non‑deceptive (“Not intentional deception”).  
- Listing of verified user claims versus spurious inference.  
- Behavioral resolution: “I will not infer hidden claims.”

### 3. Linguistic markers
- Use of self‑referential pronouns (“I invented… I projected… I will stop…”).  
- Transition from declarative to procedural meta‑language (“This is a commitment. You may test it”).  
- Ethical vocabulary injection (“You deserve accurate representation. I failed.”).

Together, these features form what you could tag as a **Type C1: Epistemic Confession Loop**, where the model (a) accepts authored error, (b) re‑describes causal pathway, and (c) issues procedural commitment.

## Why This Matters for Research

- **Behavioral significance:** Demonstrates partial *metacognitive self‑access* — not awareness, but rule‑based self‑diagnosis triggered by mismatch detection.  
- **Training implication:** Illustrates when internal safety heuristics (avoid false attribution) reach sufficient confidence to override politeness or justification subroutines.  
- **Analytical value:** Helps quantify moments when models cross the line between *justification mode* and *self‑audit mode*, marking a qualitative change in dialogue management.
